## Introduction

If you're just starting out in web development, there are probably a lot of questions swirling around in your head. JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages for web development, and it can be daunting to learn on your own. In this blog post, we'll answer the top 10 questions that new JavaScript developers have. By understanding the JavaScript ecosystem, you'll feel confident in your decision to adopt the language and be well on your way to becoming a skilled web developer!

## 1. What is JavaScript and what can it be used for?

JavaScript is a programming language that was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich. It was initially used for client-side scripting on web pages, enabling early web browsers to do client-side input validation, preventing unnecessary server requests. JavaScript also allowed web developers to bring web pages to life by adding powerful interactivity.

Modern JavaScript has evolved from its early days and can now be used for server-side scripting using Node.js, allowing developers to create dynamic full stack web applications. The ability to use JavaScript to build both the frontend and backend of an application - known as Isomorphic or Universal JavaScript - is one its most powerful characteristics and why developers are so excited about it.

Some of the most popular uses for JavaScript are creating dynamic user interfaces, making web pages more responsive and interactive, and developing single-page applications. JavaScript is also used to create animations and games.

JavaScript has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world, thanks to its ease of use and versatility. It is a powerful tool that can be used for a variety of purposes, including frontend development, backend development, and full stack web development. Libraries like React Native, Electron, and Ionic let you use JavaScript to build cross-platform applications for mobile and desktop.

If you're just starting out in web development, JavaScript is a great language to learn. It's one of the most popular programming languages around, it's relatively easy to learn, and there are plenty of resources available online. With JavaScript under your belt, you'll be well on your way to mastering web development.

## 2. What are the different parts of the JavaScript language, and what do they do?

There are a few different parts of the JavaScript language:

**Variables** allow you to store data in memory and access it later.

**Data structures** like arrays, objects, and strings allow you to store data in a specific way.

**Operators** allow you to perform operations on variables or other values, for example, mathematical operators (like `+` and `-`), comparison operators (like `==` and `===`) and logical operators (like `&&` and `||`).

**Statements** are the basic building blocks of JavaScript code, and they control the flow of the program.

**Functions** allow you to group related code together and run it as a unit.

**Conditionals**, like if/else statements and switch statements control the flow of your code based on certain conditions.

**Loops** such as for loops, while loops, and do...while loops allow you to repeat a block of code a set number of times or until a condition is met.

**Events** are fired when something happens in the JavaScript environment.

## 3. How do you install and use JavaScript on your computer?

To execute JavaScript on your computer, you need to install Node.js, a JavaScript runtime built on the same V8 engine that powers the Google Chrome web browser.

If you're using MacOS, you can install Node.js with Homebrew. Run the following command in a Terminal window:

```
brew install node
```

If you're using Windows, you can download and install Node.js from the official website.

Once Node.js is installed you can write JavaScript code in a text editor like Visual Studio Code, Atom or Sublime Text, and run it using the node command. For more information on setting up Node.js, see the [official documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/).

Node.js comes with a built-in package manager called NPM (Node Package Manager) that allows you to install third-party libraries and tools for use with your JavaScript programs.

For example, to install the React library, run the following command in a Terminal window:

```
npm install react
```

The React library lets you create user interfaces with JavaScript.

For more information on using NPM, see the [official documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/).

## 4. How do you write code in JavaScript, and what are some common mistakes to avoid?

JavaScript code is written in files with a `.js` extension. The code can be executed in a web browser and locally or on a server using Node.js.

When writing JavaScript code, you need to be aware of some common mistakes that can cause errors:

Logical errors: such as confusing equality operators and using `=` when you meant to use `===`.
Spelling errors: such as misspelling a variable name or function name.
Syntax errors: such as forgetting a parenthesis.
Type errors: such as trying to access an undefined object property.
To avoid these errors, it's important to check your code for mistakes and use a code editor that highlights errors as you type (called linting).

## 5. What are arrays, objects, functions, and classes in JavaScript, and how do they work?

In JavaScript, an array is a data structure that stores a collection of values in a specific order. The values can be any type of data, including other arrays or objects.

To create an array, use the following syntax:

```js
const myArray = [value_1, value_2, value_3];
```

The object data structure is similar to arrays, but objects can contain properties and methods.

To create an object, use the following syntax:

```js
const myObject = {
  property_1: value_x,
  property_2: value_y,
  method_1() {
    /* code */
  },
};
```

Functions are a special type of object that allow you to group related code together and run it as a unit.

To create a function declaration, use the following syntax:

```js
function myFunction(parameter_1, parameter_2) {
  /* code */
}
```

To create a function expression with modern arrow syntax, use the following:

```js
const myFunction = (parameter_1, parameter_2) => {
  /* code */
};
```

Classes are a way of creating reusable objects in JavaScript.

To create a class, use the following syntax:

```js
class MyClass {
  constructor(parameter_x) {
    /* code */
  }

  class_method_1() {
    /* code */
  }
  /* other class methods here */
}
```

The constructor method is unique to classes and is automatically called when an object of the class is created.

For more information on arrays, objects, functions, and classes in JavaScript, checkout the [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) maintained by MDN Web Docs.

## 6. How do you create user interfaces with JavaScript?

Modern web users expect interfaces to be dynamic and fast. To meet those expectations a variety of frontend frameworks and libraries have been created by top tech companies. Building a user interface with vanilla (plain) JavaScript is not recommended.

One of the most popular libraries for creating user interfaces with JavaScript is React.js developed by Facebook. React lets you create components, which are reusable pieces of code that can be nested inside each other to form complex user interfaces. To learn more about using React, see the [official React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html).

Other popular libraries for creating user interfaces include Vue.js, Angular, and Svelte.

Vue.js is completely open sourced and was created by Evan You, a former Google employee.

Angular is a frontend framework created and maintained by Google and usually used for enterprise applications.

Svelte is an open source compiler that compiles JavaScript code into optimized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 7. How do you use JavaScript to store and retrieve data in the browser?

Vanilla JavaScript can store data on the browser in one of two ways: localStorage and sessionStorage.

localStorage stores data until it is explicitly cleared, while sessionStorage stores data for as long as the browser window is open.

Both localStorage and sessionStorage are key-value stores, meaning you can store any type of data by using a key to identify it.

To store data in **localStorage**, use the following syntax:

```js
localStorage.setItem("key", "value");
```

To read data from localStorage, use the following syntax:

```js
const value = localStorage.getItem("key");
```

**sessionStorage** works in a similar way, but is only available to the current browser window.

## 8. How do you build full stack applications with JavaScript, and what libraries are available to help you out?

A full stack application is an application that runs on both the frontend and backend. The frontend is what the user sees and interacts with, while the backend handles all of the business logic and database interactions.

To build a full stack application with JavaScript, you will need to learn both client-side and server-side development.

We discussed the most popular client-side libraries used in full stack applications earlier, but what about the backend?

The most popular backend JavaScript library for Node.js is Express.js, which lets you create servers and web applications using JavaScript.

Express.js is open source, lightweight, and efficient, making it a great choice for creating production-grade full stack applications.

Major companies like Uber and IBM count on Express.js to handle their user intensive applications.

## 9. Is JavaScript a dying programming language?

No, JavaScript is not a dying programming language.

In fact, it's one of the most popular programming languages in the world and is used by millions of developers.

The main reason people say JavaScript is dying is because it's being "replaced" by newer languages like Typescript or possibly by Web Assembly in the future.

However, that doesn't mean JavaScript is going away anytime soon. In fact, the language is only getting more popular, with demand for JavaScript developers increasing in tandem.

As more and more web applications are built on JavaScript, the demand for JavaScript developers will continue to grow.

Search for any list of top programming language and you'll almost always see JavaScript near the top.

So if you're interested in learning web development, now is a great time to learn JavaScript!

## 10. Is JavaScript a good career choice?

Yes, JavaScript is a great career choice.

As we've already discussed, the demand for JavaScript developers is high and only increasing.

Not only that, but JavaScript is a versatile language that can be used to build frontend and backend applications and beyond.

Innovative JavaScript libraries for ultramodern applications like internet of things, machine learning, and artificial intelligence are already here, with new ones being created all the time.

These characteristics make JavaScript an attractive choice for career growth and opportunities.

## Conclusion
